Step 1

Make all bodies free moving, as well as introduce the collision mechanics.

    New mass = m1 + m2
    position = average prev. positions
    weighted velocity = m1v1/M + m2v2/M
    collision after p1 - p2 abs <= C(m1 + m2)   where C = 10^-2  / N where N is num of bodies.

Step 2 

Vectorise the code for efficiency
 utilise open MP pragmas

Step 3

Implement Runge Kutta time step algorithm for particle movement.

Step 4 

Parallelisation using the open mp parallisation pragmas 

step 5 is a report on the stuffs
